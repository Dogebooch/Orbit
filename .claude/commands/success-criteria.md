# Success Criteria Injection

Before implementing this feature, internalize the following success criteria.

## Success Metrics
[Paste your 2_success_metrics.md contents here]

## How to Apply These Criteria
1. **Architecture filter:** Does this approach make it possible to hit the performance targets?
2. **Tradeoff decisions:** When facing tradeoffs, use these metrics to decide.
3. **Edge case priority:** The validation checklist shows which edge cases must be handled for MVP.
4. **Testing approach:** Describe how you'd test against these specific metrics.
5. **"Good enough" calibration:** The target level tells you when to stop polishing.

Confirm you've internalized these criteria, then proceed with implementation.
