I have implemented the task using GitHub Copilot. Please review the current codebase changes against these challenges:
1. **Requirements:** Does the implementation fully meet the task requirements?
2. **Architecture:** Does it follow our defined patterns and constraints?
3. **Robustness:** Are edge cases handled?
4. **Security:** Are there any security vulnerabilities?

If issues are found, list them clearly so I can feed them back to Copilot. If it looks good, confirm the task is complete.
