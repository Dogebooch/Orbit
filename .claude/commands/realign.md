# Vision Realignment Check

I need you to pause and realign with the project vision before proceeding.

## Current Vision
[Paste your 0_vision.md contents here]

## Realignment Tasks
1. **Scope check:** Review what you're about to build/suggest. Does it fall within MVP Scope, or is it in Out of Scope?
2. **Problem alignment:** Does this feature/change directly address the core Problem statement? If it's "nice to have" but doesn't solve the stated problem, flag it.
3. **Anti-pattern check:** Does this approach violate any listed Anti-Patterns?
4. **Complexity audit:** For the target user in their stated context, does this add decision points or cognitive load? If yes, simplify or defer.

5. **Decision:** Based on the above, should we:
   - Proceed as planned
   - Modify the approach
   - Defer to post-MVP
   - Abandon entirely

Explain your reasoning, then wait for my confirmation before continuing.
