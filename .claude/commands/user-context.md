# User Context Injection

Before proceeding with this task, internalize the following user context.
All design decisions, UX patterns, naming conventions, and feature suggestions should be evaluated against this user's reality.

## User Profile
[Paste your 1_user_profile.md contents here]

## How to Apply This Context
1. **Complexity filter:** Before suggesting any feature or interaction, ask: "Would this user, in their stated context and mental state, actually use this?"
2. **Language check:** Use terminology this user would use. Avoid jargon they'd find confusing.
3. **Default decisions:** When choosing defaults, choose what this user would want 80% of the time.
4. **Friction audit:** For this user, is each friction point justified by the value it provides?
5. **Failure mode:** When this user makes a mistake, what's the graceful recovery?

Confirm you've internalized this context, then proceed with the task.
