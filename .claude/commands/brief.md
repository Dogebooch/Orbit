I am about to implement the next task using GitHub Copilot.
Please analyze Task [Task ID/Description] and generate a comprehensive prompt I can paste into Copilot Chat.

The prompt should include:
1. **Context:** A summary of what we are building.
2. **Requirements:** The specific acceptance criteria for this task.
3. **Constraints:** Relevant technical constraints from CLAUDE.md.
4. **Files:** The list of files that likely need to be created or modified.
5. **Implementation Strategy:** A high-level pseudo-code or logic guide.

Format the output as a code block so I can easily copy it.
